                <p>Despite strides made in recent years, women and gender minorities continue to be underrepresented
                     in STEM disciplines. Which raises the question, why? Is it as simple as a lack of interest? The
                      answer is no. Many girls do have an interest in STEM but sadly lose confidence in their 
                      abilities as they get older. This can be due to a variety of factors, including societal 
                      pressures, lack of self confidence, or the misconception that math is a “boy subject” and 
                      girls just aren’t as equipped for such a field. All of these contribute to girls' declining 
                      interest in STEM. Even women who make it through the education process and into the workforce 
                      are still at risk for abandoning the subject due to similar reasons. But it doesn’t have to be
                       this way. Through community and education and bringing others up, we can bridge the gender 
                       gap in STEM. Please explore our website to learn more about the cause and take some time to 
                       think about what you can do to make a difference in this field, gender minority or ally. 
                       We’re in this together.</p>
